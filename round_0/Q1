# Jackie runs a charitable coding club in her village for young people.

# The laptops that she uses have been donated by a local company but she does have some costs which she needs to fund-raise for:

# an annual fee of £x for the hall that she uses
# £y per student per month for subscriptions to the online learning platform that she uses
# Input x (the annual hall fee), y (the monthly subscription fee) and z (the number of children in the club) and output the total cost of running the club for the year.
def total_costs(x, y, z):
  total_costs = x + (12 * y * z)
  return total_costs
